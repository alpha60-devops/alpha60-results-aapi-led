# Godzilla and Monarch: Japan, USA, China and South Korea

## Summary and conclusions

The sample now includes **three Godzilla films and Monarch 101, 110, 201 and
208**, using **weeks 1–15** throughout. Weekly downloader and uploader line
graphs use the **provisional 2026 Internet-user reference of 6.1 billion**.
That reference is a project estimate; historical denominators come from ITU.

- Minus One's Japanese downloader share is **1.42%**, compared with **1.12%**
  for The New Empire and **2.41%** for Vs. Kong. The four Monarch objects
  range from **0.76% to 1.25%**. Japanese production does not imply the
  highest Japanese share in this selection.
- Vs. Kong has the highest USA downloader share: **20.73%**, versus
  **7.80%** for Minus One and **6.84%** for The New Empire. Excluding hosting
  leaves **18.53% / 4.89% / 4.26%**, respectively. Hosting changes the gap
  but does not remove it. The compared films were sampled in 2021 and 2024.
- The 2026 Monarch objects have the largest South Korean and Chinese shares:
  **Monarch 201: 13.40% Korea / 10.05% China**;
  **Monarch 208: 14.48% Korea / 10.34% China**. Both countries exceed their
  USA shares (**7.13% / 6.83%**). These geographic concentrations coexist
  with low Korean mobile rates (**1.58% / 1.59%**).
- Only **weeks 6, 7, 8, 9 and 14** survive the strict all-seven coverage
  intersection. This sparse diagnostic cannot establish robustness of every
  fifteen-week difference. Missing collection hours are not imputed.

The new Monarch objects include one- and three-episode scopes; the original
objects are films. ITU scaling adjusts the global Internet-user reference, not
episodes per object, country penetration, collection gaps or torrent inventories.
The results describe observed swarms and do not estimate viewers' nationality
or a causal production-country effect.

## Objects and observation windows

The selection combines three Godzilla films and four Monarch objects. Monarch 101 and 201 each contain three episodes (101–103 and 201–203); 110 is one episode, and 208 contains episodes 208–210. Film, episode and episode-group scopes differ. These cases cannot isolate a production-country effect from year, title, inventory or distribution. “Korea” means South Korea (KOR); North Korea is not pooled into that result.

## ITU adjustment to 2026 — provisional reference

**The 6.1-billion reference for 2026 is the project's provisional estimate,
not an official ITU 2026 observation.** The latest official release checked
on September 24, 2026 covers 2025. This status applies to every adjusted
number and adjusted-count figure on this page.

`2026 adjusted weight = raw weight × 6.1 / source-year Internet users (billions)`.
The sample-start year selects the denominator. This scales global Internet-user
growth; it does not adjust country-specific penetration, sampling coverage,
episodes per object or torrent inventories. It is not an estimate of viewers.
Applying the same multiplier to all counts within an object leaves country
shares, mobile rates, hosting rates and share-difference maps unchanged.

The historical 2023 and 2024 denominators retain the project's as-published
vintages for comparability. ITU later revised 2024 from 5.5 to 5.8 billion;
the sensitivity below makes the effect explicit. No official 2026 precision
or confidence interval is implied.

### Revised 2024 denominator sensitivity

Using the later 5.8-billion estimate changes every 2024 object’s multiplier from 1.109091 to 1.051724, lowering its adjusted weights by 5.17%. Country shares and mobile rates are unchanged. This replaces only the 2024 denominator; it is not a fully revised historical ITU series.

### Coverage sensitivity

As a conservative check, exclude every elapsed-week index that has a `-partial` export flag or overlaps an audit-reported gap in **any** compared object, from **all** objects. Partial flags can reflect member-level coverage and are not an estimate of missing hours. Retained week indices: **6, 7, 8, 9, 14**. The table compares downloader world shares; it does not impute missing observations.

## Hot and cold locations

Orange upward triangles favor the first named object; blue downward triangles favor the second. These are selected differences in **city share of the worldwide swarm**, rather than differences in raw title size. Hover or focus a triangle for its values; the following table provides the same evidence.

Vs. Kong shows a pronounced USA change between weeks 4 and 5 (April 21–27 versus April 28–May 4, 2021): downloader weight rises from **224,155 to 1,210,927**, and world share from **7.54% to 24.41%**. Excluding hosting still leaves a rise from **5.81% to 22.33%**. The weekly aggregate does not establish whether this reflects torrent-inventory changes, collection behavior or demand; it should not be attributed to a release event or mobile adoption without further evidence.

## Map projection and country outlines

The city-difference panels use **Cartofreako's native Cahill–Keyes projection**,
with its one-degree longitude registration, and **Izzi** for the vector SVG.
Each country's complete projected outline and selected city coordinates are
uniformly fitted into its panel, preserving projected proportions. Panel scales
therefore differ by country; geographic area is not comparable between panels.
City values still use the same world denominators and color scale across maps.

Natural Earth v5.1.2 1:10m country polygons have intersecting lake and reservoir
water removed. Interior rings are retained with even-odd filling, and country
polygons are split at the registered octant seams before projection. This keeps
Great Lakes shorelines visible and avoids lines bridging projection cuts.
Boundaries follow Natural Earth's de facto geometry. The previously published
Pitt resolution plates retain their original inputs and documented country crops.

## Methods and limits

- **Units:** sum `downloaders.size` or `uploaders.size` in the top-level
  `features` array of each weekly aggregate GeoJSON. Summing the selected intervals
  produces repeated swarm weights across weeks and torrents, not unique people,
  unique addresses over the full window, or completed views. The nested
  `collection_week_by_btiha` is not added again.
- **Window:** weeks 1–15 inclusive, including the opening bin. Every selected
  interval spans seven calendar days within the actual sample cutoff. Some bins
  carry a `-partial` member-coverage flag or overlap an audit gap; the sensitivity
  excludes those elapsed-week indices from every object. Calendar dates differ.
  Matching elapsed weeks does not match release conditions or hourly coverage.
- **Shares:** country or city downloader weight divided by worldwide downloader
  weight over the same intervals, including unclassified-country features.
  Pooled shares use sums of counts, not the unweighted mean of weekly percentages.
  Uploader shares have a separate uploader denominator.
- **Flags:** mobile, hosting and VPN rates divide the country's flagged weight by
  that country's size for the same role. Flags overlap. A mobile flag describes
  IP network classification, not a device, connection technology, citizenship,
  residence or verified audience. Wi-Fi versus cellular usage is not resolved.
- **Hosting sensitivity:** subtract hosting from size in both country and global
  denominators. This removes one flag; it does not identify residential traffic.
- **Difference maps:** geolocated city aggregates keyed by country and GeoNames ID, using
  source representative coordinates. Only shared identified cities with at least
  100 combined downloader weight qualify. Show at most two positive and two
  negative differences per country, ranked by percentage-point difference.
  An absent or suppressed location is not zero. Triangles indicate sign;
  color intensity encodes magnitude on a symmetric scale shared by all difference maps on this page.
  “Hot” and “cold” describe larger and smaller observed shares, without a test of
  statistical significance. They do not describe population-adjusted demand.
- **Export:** all selected files declare H3 resolution 5 and minimum swarm size 3.
  Geographic filtering and aggregation mean these denominators differ from
  companion JSON unique-BTIH totals. Do not interpret the discrepancy as a known
  missing-data percentage. Weekly JSON `collection_week` values are cumulative
  prefixes; the geographic interval series used here is a different product.
