# The Pitt and The Bear: India, Philippines, Australia

## Summary and conclusions

This comparison now includes **Bear seasons 2–5** and the two Pitt episode
objects. Matched tables use **weeks 1–10**; an extended view shows available
weeks through 26, and a separate Pitt 213–215 / Bear S05 comparison aligns
their overlapping 2026 calendar dates.

**2026-adjusted counts use the project's provisional 6.1-billion Internet-user
estimate. It is not an official ITU 2026 measurement.** Raw counts remain
visible; the adjustment leaves geographic shares and mobile rates unchanged.

- Over weeks 1–10, Bear S02 has the highest downloader world share among these
  six objects in all three countries: **India 1.29%, Philippines 0.92%, and
  Australia 4.21%**. Its smaller worldwide swarm means that the highest share
  does not imply the highest count.
- On the provisional 2026 count scale, Bear S03 leads in India (**265,429**),
  Bear S02 in the Philippines (**83,986**), and Bear S04 in Australia
  (**604,374**). These are repeated swarm weights over the ten bins, not
  people. Historical ITU revisions and unequal media scope limit precision.
- The first-week inclusion changes the original Pitt/Bear S05 comparison:
  Pitt 213–215 and Bear S05 have virtually equal India shares (both **0.40%**
  when rounded), while Pitt 201–203 is **0.63%**. Pitt 213–215's Australian
  share is **1.67%**, versus **1.41%** for Bear S05.
- Philippine mobile-network rates span **19.64–24.79%** across the six
  objects; Australian rates span **3.05–7.07%**. These describe IP-network
  classification, not phone viewing or Wi-Fi versus cellular usage.

The country close-ups below combine the audit's **≥1080p** and **<1080p**
resolution groups for Pitt 201–203 across **weeks 1–26**, with individual
resolution-group values and sources available for inspection.

## Objects and observation windows

The comparison includes two three-episode Pitt groups from 2026 and Bear seasons 2–5, sampled in 2023–2026 respectively. Episode groups and a whole-season torrent inventory have different scopes. These are object-specific comparisons, not a ranking of the two entire series. The Bear special (`bear-00`) remains outside this selection.

- **The Bear S02:** Hourly discontinuities: 2 (27 missing hours); Missing days: 0; hourly gap: last `2023-08-29 09:06`, resumed `2023-08-29 14:06` — missing 4 hour(s); hourly gap: last `2023-12-01 22:06`, resumed `2023-12-02 22:30` — missing 23 hour(s)
- **The Bear S03:** Hourly discontinuities: 2 (48 missing hours); Missing days: 1; hourly gap: last `2024-12-12 22:00`, resumed `2024-12-13 00:00` — missing 1 hour(s); hourly gap: last `2024-12-28 22:00`, resumed `2024-12-30 22:00` — missing 47 hour(s); missing day: `2024-12-29`
- **The Bear S04:** No gap inventory found; this does not establish complete hourly coverage.

These are full-sample audit notes. Only dates overlapping the selected intervals enter the coverage sensitivity below. Opening bins are retained. Missing hours are not imputed.

## ITU adjustment to 2026 — provisional reference

**The 6.1-billion reference for 2026 is the project's provisional estimate,
not an official ITU 2026 observation.** The latest official release checked
on September 24, 2026 covers 2025. This status applies to every adjusted
number and adjusted-count figure on this page.

`2026 adjusted weight = raw weight × 6.1 / source-year Internet users (billions)`.
The sample-start year selects the denominator. This scales global Internet-user
growth; it does not adjust country-specific penetration, sampling coverage,
episodes per object or torrent inventories. It is not an estimate of viewers.
Applying the same multiplier to all counts within an object leaves country
shares, mobile rates, hosting rates and share-difference maps unchanged.

The historical 2023 and 2024 denominators retain the project's as-published
vintages for comparability. ITU later revised 2024 from 5.5 to 5.8 billion;
the sensitivity below makes the effect explicit. No official 2026 precision
or confidence interval is implied.

| Object | Sample year | Internet users (billions) | 2026 factor | Raw world downloaders | 2026 adjusted world downloaders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Pitt 201–203 | 2026 | 6.1 | 1.000000 | 30,189,674 | 30,189,674 |
| The Pitt 213–215 | 2026 | 6.1 | 1.000000 | 29,493,965 | 29,493,965 |
| The Bear S05 | 2026 | 6.1 | 1.000000 | 37,986,540 | 37,986,540 |
| The Bear S02 | 2023 | 5.4 | 1.129630 | 8,088,885 | 9,137,444 |
| The Bear S03 | 2024 | 5.5 | 1.109091 | 20,412,154 | 22,638,934 |

### Revised 2024 denominator sensitivity

Using the later 5.8-billion estimate changes every 2024 object’s multiplier from 1.109091 to 1.051724, lowering its adjusted weights by 5.17%. Country shares and mobile rates are unchanged. This replaces only the 2024 denominator; it is not a fully revised historical ITU series.

| Country | 2024 object | Adjusted with 5.5b | Adjusted with revised 5.8b |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| India | The Bear S03 | 265,429 | 251,700 |
| Philippines | The Bear S03 | 75,531 | 71,625 |
| Australia | The Bear S03 | 421,723 | 399,910 |

### Coverage sensitivity

As a conservative check, exclude every elapsed-week index that has a `-partial` export flag or overlaps an audit-reported gap in **any** compared object, from **all** objects. Partial flags can reflect member-level coverage and are not an estimate of missing hours. Retained week indices: **6**. The table compares downloader world shares; it does not impute missing observations.

| Country | Object | Weeks 1–10 share | Retained-weeks share |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| India | The Pitt 201–203 | 0.63% | 0.59% |
| India | The Pitt 213–215 | 0.40% | 0.35% |
| India | The Bear S05 | 0.40% | 0.34% |
| India | The Bear S02 | 1.29% | 1.15% |
| India | The Bear S03 | 1.17% | 0.96% |
| India | The Bear S04 | 0.79% | 0.68% |
| Philippines | The Pitt 201–203 | 0.20% | 0.15% |

| Philippines | The Bear S02 | 0.92% | 0.86% |
| Philippines | The Bear S03 | 0.33% | 0.22% |
| Philippines | The Bear S04 | 0.26% | 0.21% |
| Australia | The Pitt 201–203 | 1.45% | 1.21% |

| Australia | The Bear S03 | 1.86% | 1.47% |
| Australia | The Bear S04 | 1.91% | 1.52% |

This leaves 1 of 10 intervals. It is a sparse coverage diagnostic; missing observations are not estimated.

## Pitt 201–203: combined resolution country close-ups

These six plates cover **Philippines (PHL), Australia (AUS), India (IND),
Japan (JPN), China (CHN), and South Korea (KOR)**, with **≥1080p (1080 and
2160)** and **<1080p (720 and SD)** together on each country map. They cover
**weeks 1–26, January 9–July 9, 2026**. Pink filled circles show ≥1080p;
orange rings show <1080p. Circle **area** represents downloader weight on
one scale across all six plates. The two groups share city centers.
Hover or focus a circle for its count and mobile rate.

The source is the weekly **by-BTIH geographic product**, joined to all 392
canonical, unique-BTIH torrent records by member ID and exact name: 236 torrents
at ≥1080p and 156 below 1080p; none have unclassified resolution. Weights repeat
across torrents and weeks. This product has a different aggregation grain from
the top-level weekly geographic product used in the comparison tables above;
its totals are not interchangeable with those tables or unique-person counts.
Missing sampling hours remain unadjusted, including the reported July 3 gap.

**Izzi and Cartofreako** draw the vector plates using the audit's registered
Cahill–Keyes projection. Each country outline and its mapped city
coordinates fit the available panel width or height while preserving projected
proportions. Geographic scale differs by country. Lake water is removed from
the land polygons; interior holes and projection seams are preserved.
Australia retains the mainland/Tasmania close-up; offshore islands across a
projection cut would shrink the mainland. All sampled Australian cities fit
this extent. The other five countries use their complete outlines.

| Country | Resolution group | Downloader weight | Mobile rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Hot and cold locations

Orange upward triangles favor the first named object; blue downward triangles favor the second. These are selected differences in **city share of the worldwide swarm**, rather than differences in raw title size. Hover or focus a triangle for its values; the following table provides the same evidence.

## Weeks 1–26: available coverage

The extended view retains every available seven-day interval through week 26.
Lines stop at the last full calendar bin: missing future weeks and shorter
trailing bins are not zero. Full-length bins can still contain sampling gaps
or a `-partial` member-coverage flag. The matched ten-week tables above remain
separate from this unequal-length view.

## Same-calendar comparison: Pitt 213–215 versus Bear S05

The two samples overlap in 2026, although they begin 12 weeks apart: April 3
for Pitt 213–215 and June 26 for Bear S05. This comparison pairs **June 26–
September 10, 2026**, matching Pitt elapsed weeks **13–23** to Bear weeks
**1–11**. The shared one-day trailing bin on September 11 is excluded.

This aligns calendar conditions while comparing different points in each
object’s sampling history. The three-episode-versus-season scope still differs.
Both are 2026 samples, so the provisional ITU multiplier is 1: adjusted weights
equal raw weights. The sums below remain repeated swarm weights, not people.

Worldwide downloader denominators over these paired bins: The Pitt 213–215 **32,520,151**; The Bear S05 **41,050,272**.

| Country | Object | Downloader weight / 2026 adjusted | World share | Mobile rate | Hosting rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| India | The Pitt 213–215 | 97,780 | 0.30% | 17.46% | 5.63% |
| India | The Bear S05 | 164,699 | 0.40% | 18.37% | 5.38% |
| Philippines | The Pitt 213–215 | 46,485 | 0.14% | 20.94% | 1.35% |
| Philippines | The Bear S05 | 75,024 | 0.18% | 19.85% | 1.27% |
| Australia | The Pitt 213–215 | 320,906 | 0.99% | 2.86% | 26.10% |
| Australia | The Bear S05 | 571,946 | 1.39% | 3.09% | 32.23% |


Over the shared calendar window, Bear S05 has higher downloader weights and worldwide shares in all three countries: India **0.40% versus 0.30%**, Philippines **0.18% versus 0.14%**, and Australia **1.39% versus 0.99%**. This differs from the opening-ten-week comparison, where Pitt 213–215 has higher Philippine and Australian shares than Bear S05. The window choice materially changes those two comparisons. Mobile rates are close: Pitt is higher in the Philippines (**20.94% versus 19.85%**), while Bear is higher in India (**18.37% versus 17.46%**) and Australia (**3.09% versus 2.86%**). These observations do not isolate a release-timing effect.

During this window, the Pitt audit reports one missing hour on August 30–31 and nine on September 10–11; Bear reports 29 missing hours spanning August 14–16. The last Pitt gap straddles the end of the selected period. Missing observations are not imputed. These counts should not be interpreted as equally complete samples.

## Map projection and country outlines

The city-difference panels use **Cartofreako's native Cahill–Keyes projection**,
with its one-degree longitude registration, and **Izzi** for the vector SVG.
Each country's complete projected outline and selected city coordinates are
uniformly fitted into its panel, preserving projected proportions. Panel scales
therefore differ by country; geographic area is not comparable between panels.
City values still use the same world denominators and color scale across maps.

Natural Earth v5.1.2 1:10m country polygons have intersecting lake and reservoir
water removed. Interior rings are retained with even-odd filling, and country
polygons are split at the registered octant seams before projection. This keeps
Great Lakes shorelines visible and avoids lines bridging projection cuts.
Boundaries follow Natural Earth's de facto geometry. The six Pitt resolution
plates use this same vector geometry, with their original weekly by-BTIH input
method and one shared circle-area scale across countries.

## Methods and limits

- **Units:** sum `downloaders.size` or `uploaders.size` in the top-level
  `features` array of each weekly aggregate GeoJSON. Summing the selected intervals
  produces repeated swarm weights across weeks and torrents, not unique people,
  unique addresses over the full window, or completed views. The nested
  `collection_week_by_btiha` is not added again.
- **Window:** the matched tables and city-difference maps use weeks 1–10,
  including the opening week. The extended trend uses available seven-day bins
  through week 26 and leaves unavailable or shorter trailing bins unplotted.
  Pitt-201 resolution plates use weeks 1–26 of the separate by-BTIH product.
  A calendar-aligned comparison uses exactly matching seven-day intervals.
  Partial flags and audit gaps remain visible; no missing weights are imputed.
- **Shares:** country or city downloader weight divided by worldwide downloader
  weight over the same intervals, including unclassified-country features.
  Pooled shares use sums of counts, not the unweighted mean of weekly percentages.
  Uploader shares have a separate uploader denominator.
- **Flags:** mobile, hosting and VPN rates divide the country's flagged weight by
  that country's size for the same role. Flags overlap. A mobile flag describes
  IP network classification, not a device, connection technology, citizenship,
  residence or verified audience. Wi-Fi versus cellular usage is not resolved.
- **Hosting sensitivity:** subtract hosting from size in both country and global
  denominators. This removes one flag; it does not identify residential traffic.
- **Difference maps:** geolocated city aggregates keyed by country and GeoNames ID, using
  source representative coordinates. Only shared identified cities with at least
  100 combined downloader weight qualify. Show at most two positive and two
  negative differences per country, ranked by percentage-point difference.
  An absent or suppressed location is not zero. Triangles indicate sign;
  color intensity encodes magnitude on a symmetric scale shared by all difference maps on this page.
  “Hot” and “cold” describe larger and smaller observed shares, without a test of
  statistical significance. They do not describe population-adjusted demand.
- **Export:** all selected files declare H3 resolution 5 and minimum swarm size 3.
  Geographic filtering and aggregation mean these denominators differ from
  companion JSON unique-BTIH totals. Do not interpret the discrepancy as a known
  missing-data percentage. Weekly JSON `collection_week` values are cumulative
  prefixes; the geographic interval series used here is a different product.
